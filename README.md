# .github Repository

This repository serves as the default community health repository for the RBIH-SGDO organization on GitHub. It contains default community health files, including issue and pull request templates, contributing guidelines, code of conduct, and other important files that apply to all repositories in this organization.

## Purpose

The `.github` repository is a special repository that automatically applies its files to every repository within the organization that does not contain its own version of those files. This helps maintain consistency and standardization across all projects within our organization.

## Contents

- **Issue Templates**: Help contributors to provide the necessary information when reporting bugs or suggesting enhancements.
- **Pull Request Templates**: Guide contributors to include comprehensive details in their pull requests to streamline review processes.
- **Contributing Guidelines**: Provide potential project contributors with information about how they can contribute to the projects.
- **Code of Conduct**: Outlines expectations for participation in our community, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behavior.
- **Support Files**: Includes contact information or links to support resources for community members needing assistance.

## How to Use This Repository

- **For Organization Members**: When creating issues or pull requests within our organization's repositories, use the templates provided here by default. Modify the templates as necessary to better suit specific repositories or projects.

## Contribution

Contributions to this repository are welcome, especially to update or refine the documents it contains to keep them effective and relevant. If you have suggestions or improvements, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.
